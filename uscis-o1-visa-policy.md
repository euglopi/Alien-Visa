### Evidentiary Requirements

Petitioners must provide **either**:

1. A major internationally recognized award (e.g., Nobel Prize, Academy Award)

**OR**

Meet **at least three (3)** of the following eight criteria:

| # | Criterion | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Awards | Nationally/internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence |
| 2 | Memberships | Association membership requiring outstanding achievements judged by recognized experts |
| 3 | Published Material | Articles in professional/major publications about the beneficiary's work |
| 4 | Judging | Experience evaluating others' work in the field |
| 5 | Original Contributions | Contributions of major significance to the field |
| 6 | Scholarly Articles | Articles in professional journals or major media |
| 7 | Critical Employment | Essential role with distinguished organizations |
| 8 | High Remuneration | Salary significantly above field standards |

---

### Comparable Evidence

When standard criteria don't readily apply to a beneficiary's occupation, petitioners may submit **comparable evidence** demonstrating equivalent significance, provided they still meet the three-criterion minimum.

---

### Totality Analysis

> **Note:** Meeting evidentiary requirements does not automatically establish eligibility. Officers must evaluate all evidence to determine whether beneficiaries genuinely meet the relevant standard for extraordinary ability or achievement.

---

### MPTV Classification Guidance

The following generally fall under MPTV classification:
- Streaming productions
- Web series
- Commercials

**Exception:** Artists appearing for interviews or promotional purposes in television may qualify as O-1B (Arts) instead if MPTV work is incidental to their primary artistic work.

---

### Area of Extraordinary Ability

| Classification | Scope |
|----------------|-------|
| O-1A & O-1B (Arts) | Work must involve "shared skillsets, knowledge, or expertise" with fields where acclaim was established. Transitions between related occupations (athlete → coach, researcher → entrepreneur) may qualify. |
| O-1B (MPTV) | Broadly encompasses any work within the MPTV industry |
