## A. Standard for Classification

In order to qualify as an alien of "extraordinary ability" in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (commonly referred to as **O-1A**), or in arts (commonly referred to as **O-1B (Arts)**), a beneficiary must have **"sustained national or international acclaim."**

The regulations define "extraordinary ability" as applied to the O-1 classification as follows:

> **In the field of science, education, business, or athletics:** a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field of endeavor.

## B. Determining Eligibility for O-1 Classification

For an O-1 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129), the officer must determine whether the beneficiary meets the relevant standard outlined in the statute and regulations.

The regulations describe the various types of evidence the petitioner must submit in support of a petition for each type of O-1 beneficiary. In general, the petition must be accompanied by either:

1. Evidence of receipt of a qualifying award (such as the Nobel Prize), **OR**
2. At least **three** alternate forms of evidence

**Important:** The evidentiary requirements are not the standard for the classification, but are instead the mechanism for establishing whether the standard is met. The fact that the petitioner has produced evidence satisfying at least three evidentiary criteria does not necessarily establish that the beneficiary is eligible for the O-1 classification. Rather, USCIS must determine eligibility based on whether the **totality of the evidence** submitted demonstrates that the beneficiary meets the relevant standard.

---

## C. O-1A Evidentiary Criteria

The supporting documentation for an O-1A petition must include evidence that the beneficiary has received a major internationally recognized award (such as the Nobel Prize) **OR** satisfies **at least three** of the following evidentiary criteria:

---

### Criterion 1: Awards

**Regulatory Language:**
> Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
1. Whether the person was the recipient of prizes or awards in the field of endeavor
2. Whether the award is a nationally or internationally recognized prize or award for excellence

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Awards from well-known national institutions and well-known professional associations
- Certain doctoral dissertation awards and scholarships
- Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences

**Considerations:**
- The criteria used to grant the awards or prizes
- The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field
- The number of awardees or prize recipients
- Limitations on eligible competitors

**Notes:**
- A person may rely on a team award, provided the person is one of the recipients
- This criterion does not require an award to have the same prestige as a Nobel Prize
- An award available only to persons within a single locality, employer, or school may have little national/international recognition
- An award open to members of a well-known national institution (including R1 or R2 doctoral universities) may be nationally recognized

---

### Criterion 2: Membership

**Regulatory Language:**
> Documentation of the beneficiary's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
- Whether the association requires that members have outstanding achievements in the field as judged by recognized experts

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Membership in certain professional associations
- Fellowships with certain organizations or institutions

**Positive Examples:**
- IEEE Fellow level membership (requires "accomplishments that have contributed importantly to the advancement or application of engineering, science and technology")
- AAAI Fellow membership (based on "significant, sustained contributions" to AI, judged by current fellows)

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
- Membership based solely on a level of education or years of experience
- Membership based on payment of a fee or subscribing to publications
- Membership based on a requirement for employment (such as union membership)

---

### Criterion 3: Published Material

**Regulatory Language:**
> Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary's work in the field for which classification is sought. This evidence must include the title, date, and author of such published material and any necessary translation.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
1. Whether the published material was related to the person and their specific work
2. Whether the publication qualifies as a professional publication, major trade publication, or major media

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Professional or major print publications (newspaper articles, journal articles, books, textbooks) regarding the beneficiary and their work
- Professional or major online publications regarding the beneficiary and their work
- Transcript of professional or major audio or video coverage of the beneficiary and their work

**Considerations:**
- Published material that includes only a brief citation or passing reference is NOT sufficient
- The beneficiary need not be the only subject; material covering a broader topic but including substantial discussion of the beneficiary's work qualifies
- Material focusing on work by a team qualifies if it mentions the beneficiary or documents their significant role
- Relevant factors include intended audience and relative circulation, readership, or viewership

---

### Criterion 4: Judging

**Regulatory Language:**
> Evidence of the beneficiary's participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization for which classification is sought.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
- Whether the person has acted as the judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Reviewer of abstracts or papers submitted for presentation at scholarly conferences
- Peer reviewer for scholarly publications
- Member of doctoral dissertation committees
- Peer reviewer for government research funding programs

**Considerations:**
- Must show actual participation in judging, not just invitations
- Example: A copy of a request from a journal to do a review, accompanied by evidence confirming the review was completed

---

### Criterion 5: Original Contributions

**Regulatory Language:**
> Evidence of the beneficiary's original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
1. Whether the person has made original contributions in the field
2. Whether the original contributions are of major significance to the field

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Published materials about the significance of the beneficiary's original work
- Testimonials, letters, and affidavits about the beneficiary's original work and its significance
- Documentation that the work was cited at a level indicative of major significance
- Documentation that the work was published in a scholarly journal of distinguished reputation
- Patents or licenses deriving from the beneficiary's work
- Evidence of commercial use of the beneficiary's work (e.g., commercialization of a research innovation)
- Contributions to repositories of software, data, designs, protocols, or other technical resources with evidence of significant impact
- A letter from an interested government agency explaining the significance of the work

**Considerations:**
- Evidence that work was funded, patented, or published does NOT alone establish major significance
- Published research that has provoked widespread commentary and high citations may be probative
- A patented technology that has attracted significant attention or commercialization may establish significance
- Detailed letters from experts explaining the nature and significance are valuable, especially with corroborating documentation
- Letters should specifically describe the contribution and its significance, and set forth the writer's knowledge and expertise

---

### Criterion 6: Scholarly Articles

**Regulatory Language:**
> Evidence of the beneficiary's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
1. Whether the person has authored scholarly articles in the field
2. Whether the publication qualifies as professional, major trade, or major media

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Publications in professionally-relevant journals
- Published conference presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences

**Considerations:**
- The beneficiary must be a listed author but need not be the sole or first author
- A petitioner need NOT provide evidence that the work has been cited to meet this criterion
- Articles must be scholarly: reporting on original research, experimentation, or philosophical discourse
- Generally peer-reviewed with footnotes, endnotes, or bibliography
- In non-academic arenas, should be written for learned persons in that field

---

### Criterion 7: Critical Employment

**Regulatory Language:**
> Evidence that the beneficiary has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
1. Whether the person has performed in a leading or critical role for an organization or establishment
2. Whether the organization or establishment has a distinguished reputation

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Faculty or research position for a distinguished academic department or program
- Research position for a distinguished non-academic institution, government entity, or company
- Principal or named investigator for a department that received a merit-based government award (e.g., SBIR grant)
- Member of a key committee or high-performing team within a distinguished organization
- Founder or co-founder of, or contributor of IP to, a startup business with a distinguished reputation
- Critical or essential supporting role for a distinguished organization, as explained by the director or PI

**Considerations for "Critical or Essential":**
- Critical role: contributed in a way of significant importance to the organization's activities
- Essential role: role is or was integral to the entity
- A leadership role often qualifies as critical or essential
- It is the duties and performance, not the title, that determines if the role is critical
- The organization need not have directly employed the beneficiary
- Letters from persons with personal knowledge of the role's significance are helpful

**Considerations for "Distinguished Reputation":**
- Scale of customer base, longevity, or relevant media coverage
- For academic departments: national rankings and receipt of government research grants
- For startups: evidence of significant funding from government entities, venture capital, angel investors, or other funders

---

### Criterion 8: High Salary

**Regulatory Language:**
> Evidence that the beneficiary has either commanded a high salary or will command a high salary or other remuneration for services as evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.

**What USCIS Evaluates:**
- Whether the person has commanded or will command a high salary or other remuneration

**Examples of Relevant Evidence:**
- Tax returns, pay statements, or other evidence of past salary
- Contract, job offer letter, or other evidence of prospective salary
- Comparative wage or remuneration data for the beneficiary's field (e.g., compensation surveys)

**Considerations:**
- The burden is on the petitioner to provide evidence that compensation is high relative to others in the field
- Helpful resources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data, Department of Labor's Career One Stop
- For persons working outside the U.S.: evaluate based on wage statistics for that locality, not by converting to USD
- For entrepreneurs/founders: evidence of significant funding may help evaluate credibility of prospective salary evidence

---

## D. Comparable Evidence

If the listed criteria are not readily applicable to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence.

**When to Use:**
- Petitioners should submit evidence from the listed criteria if they readily apply
- If a particular criterion is not readily applicable to the beneficiary's occupation, comparable evidence may be submitted
- Must explain why the criterion is not readily applicable AND why the submitted evidence is "comparable"
- A general unsupported assertion is not sufficient; must be detailed, specific, and credible

**Examples:**
- If publication of scholarly articles is not readily applicable to an industry role, presenting work at a major trade show might be comparable
- If high salary is not readily applicable to an entrepreneur, highly valued equity holdings might be comparable

**Requirements:**
- Must still meet at least three separate evidentiary criteria (including comparable evidence)
- The use of comparable evidence does not change the standard for classification

---

## E. Evaluating the Totality of the Evidence

When evidentiary requirements are satisfied, the officer evaluates the **totality of all evidence** to determine whether the beneficiary has extraordinary ability with sustained national or international acclaim.

Officers may consider any potentially relevant evidence, even if it does not fit regulatory criteria:

**Additional Positive Factors:**
- Articles published in highly-ranked journals (as shown by impact factor)
- High total rate of citations relative to others in the field, or high h-index
- Employment or research experience with leading institutions (R1/R2 universities, highly-ranked foreign universities)
- Unsolicited invitations to speak at nationally/internationally recognized conferences
- Named as investigator on peer-reviewed, competitively funded government grants for STEM research
- Letter from a government agency attesting to sustained national or international acclaim

---

## F. Continuing to Work in the Area of Extraordinary Ability

A petitioner must demonstrate that the O-1A beneficiary is coming to the United States to continue work in the "area of extraordinary ability."

USCIS interprets "area of extraordinary ability" broadly to include not only the specific occupation(s) in which the beneficiary has garnered acclaim, but also other occupations that involve **shared skillsets, knowledge, or expertise**.

**Relevant Factors:**
- Whether past and prospective occupations are in the same industry or share duties/expertise
- Whether the prospective occupation is a supervisory/management role requiring shared knowledge
- Whether it is common for persons in one occupation to transition to the other

**Examples of Valid Transitions:**
- Acclaimed athlete coming to be a coach
- Renowned STEM professor coming to work for a private company
- Engineer coming to start a technology company
- Acclaimed dancer coming to be a dance teacher or choreographer
